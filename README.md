Perfect! To troubleshoot your TransactionHistory UI error thoroughly, I need to see the code that’s directly involved with the crash.

Which of these should you provide:

The full TransactionHistory widget code (if you haven’t updated it yet).

Your MonthlyPlan and WeeklyPlan model classes, including the paymentDates field.

Your MonthlyViewModel and WeeklyViewModel, showing how you generate and store paymentDates.

Any UI code that calls TransactionHistory or uses the plans list.

Which one do you want to start with?
